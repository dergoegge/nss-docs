Notable Changes in NSS 3.36.1
-----------------------------

-  In NSS version 3.35 the iteration count in optimized builds, which is
   used for password based encryption algorithm related toÂ encrypted
   PKCS#7 or PKCS#12 data, was increased to one million iterations. That
   change had caused an interoperability regression with operating
   systems that are limited to 600 K iterations. NSS 3.36.1 has been
   changed to use the same 600 K limit.

Compatibility
-------------

NSS 3.36.1 shared libraries are backward compatible with all older NSS
3.x shared libraries. A program linked with older NSS 3.x shared
libraries will work with NSS 3.36.1 shared libraries without recompiling
or relinking. Furthermore, applications that restrict their use of NSS
APIs to the functions listed in NSS Public Functions will remain
compatible with future versions of the NSS shared libraries.
