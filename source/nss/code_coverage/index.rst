Results explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _Files:

Files
^^^^^

-  Results from every C file are on new line.
-  If file was tested, link points to annotated source file (in TCOV
   directory), otherwise to original source file (CVS directory).

.. _Colors:

Colors
^^^^^^

-  Green: 70-100% of blocks tested.
-  Yellow: 40-70% of blocks tested.
-  Orange: 0-40% of blocks tested.
-  Red: file not tested. File is not part of any binary or library used
   by test suite.

.. _Numbers_in_tested_files:

Numbers in tested files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Example: 72.69% (165/227/731)

   -  72.69% - ratio of tested blocks and total blocks in file
      (generated by TCOV).
   -  165 - tested blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
   -  227 - total blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
   -  31 - total lines in file (by wc -l command).

.. _Numbers_in_not_tested_files:

Numbers in not tested files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Example: Not tested (0/?/878).

   -  0 - tested blocks in file (always 0).
   -  Â ? - total blocks in file (there is no trivial method to get this
      number without TCOV).
   -  878 - total lines in file (by wc -l command).

.. _Numbers_in_total_count:

Numbers in total count
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Example: Total: 42% (574/1351).

   -  42% - ratio of tested blocks and total blocks in file.
   -  165 - tested blocks in all files in directory (sum of numbers
      generated by TCOV).
   -  227 - total blocks in all files in directory (sum of numbers
      generated by TCOV).

-  These numbers doesn't count blocks in files which are not tested
   (marked with red color), because we don't know number of blocks
   there.
-  Total count at the end of report counts blocks in all tested files in
   all directories.
